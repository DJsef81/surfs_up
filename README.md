# PURPOSE OF ANALYSIS 

I want to open a business in Oahu, Hawaii called Surf nâ€™ Shake Shop, a business that sells  surfboards and ice cream. 
However, I need an investor to make this happen. A potential investor is  W. Avey, but he has invested in a surf shop before, and it ended poorly due to circumstances of weather. So he has asked me to do a Weather analysis of Oahu to inform his decision. 

W. Avy is concerned about the amount of precipitation on Oahu. There needs to be enough rain to keep everything green, but not so much that you lose out on that ideal surfing and ice cream weather.

By analyzing the last 12 months precipitation levels loaded into my SQLite database, we wanted to show that the data backs up the hypothesis that Oahu is the perfect place to surf. 

We used August 23, 2017 because it's the anniversary of the first time he ever went surfing and had ice cream on the same day.

Get a visual understanding of trends in the data, we then created a plot of precipitation scores in chronological order. Rather than simply showing Avey whether it rained on a given day, we showed him how much it rained and if it was raining on the previous or subsequent days as well.

We then used Flask, which let me display my results in a webpage for other potential investors to easily look at. 

Afterwards, Avey requested temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. Below are the results of that analysis.
